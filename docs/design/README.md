# Design Documents

Every new feature in this repo gets a design document here **before** it gets code. The point isn't
ceremony — it's that a year from now, the "why" behind a command's shape (why this package, why this
flag, what we rejected) is recoverable without archaeology through git history and PR threads.

## Process

1. **Write the design doc first.** Copy the [template](#template) into
   `docs/design/NNNN-short-slug.md`, using the next free four-digit number.
2. **Get agreement on it** — on the doc, not on the diff. Decisions are cheapest to change here.
3. **Implement**, then update the doc if the implementation taught you something the design got
   wrong. A design doc that quietly diverges from the shipped behavior is worse than none.
4. **Set the status line** to `Implemented` (with the PR link) when it lands.

A design doc is not a substitute for user-facing docs. Command summaries, flag descriptions, and
examples still live in each package's `messages/*.md` and README — see the root `CONTRIBUTING.md`
checklist. The design doc records the reasoning; `messages/` records the behavior.

## When a design doc is required

- Any new command, or a new subtopic.
- Any change to an existing command's flags, output shape, or error behavior that users would
  notice.
- Any new shared module in `simply-plugin-kit`, or a change to how packages depend on each other —
  including how plugins consume the libraries published from the sibling `simply-node` repo
  (`simply-core`, `simply-aep-core`, `simply-apex-core`, `simply-document-core`, `simply-report`).

Not required for: bug fixes that restore documented behavior, dependency bumps, test-only changes,
refactors that keep the public surface identical (though a short doc is welcome for large ones —
`packages/simply-cicd/REFACTOR-PLAN.md` is that kind of document).

## Template

```markdown
# NNNN — Title

**Status:** Draft | Planned | Implemented (PR #N) | Superseded by NNNN
**Package:** the `packages/*` this lands in
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Problem

What the user can't do today, and why that hurts.

## Decision

The one-paragraph answer: what we're building and where it lives.

## Behavior

The user-visible contract — command name, flags, resolution rules, output, errors. Tables beat
prose for lookup rules.

## Alternatives considered

Each option we rejected and the specific reason. This section is the one future readers come back
for.

## Implementation plan

Files added/changed, in the order they'd be written.

## Testing

Unit and NUT coverage, and what each case pins down.

## Open questions

Anything deliberately left undecided, and who decides it.
