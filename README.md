Simply is a collection of [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli) plugins built by [SimplySF](https://github.com/SimplySF) that add commands for working with Apex, Apex Enterprise Patterns, CI/CD pipelines, Communities, data, documentation generation, Flows, packages, permissions, projects, schema visualization, and SObjects in Salesforce orgs.

📖 **[Documentation site](https://simplysf.github.io/simply-plugins/)** — guides and command reference for every plugin, with [`simply-cicd`](https://simplysf.github.io/simply-plugins/cicd/) covered in the most depth.

This repo holds the oclif CLI plugins themselves. The underlying, framework-independent libraries they're built on (querying/bulk-export/CSV utilities, AT4DX scan logic, Apex execute/log logic, document rendering, HTML report scaffolding) live in the sibling [`simply-node`](https://github.com/SimplySF/simply-node) repo and are consumed here as ordinary npm dependencies.

## Packages

This repository is a monorepo. Thirteen packages are published independently to npm as CLI plugins, plus one shared internal library used by them:

Internal library — consumed by the plugins above, not a Salesforce CLI plugin itself:

| [`@simplysf/simply-plugin-kit`](packages/simply-plugin-kit) | Shared oclif command building blocks |

See each package's README for its full command reference.

`@simplysf/simply-cicd` is published on its own and is **not** bundled into the orchestrator — install it directly if you want its commands.
