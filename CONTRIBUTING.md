## Repository Structure

This repository is a Lerna monorepo containing thirteen Salesforce CLI plugins, plus one internal library. Every package has its own `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering what's specific to it — read this file first, then that one.

The "bundled" column matters when you change a flag: see [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) below.

The framework-independent libraries these plugins consume (`@simplysf/simply-core`,
`@simplysf/simply-aep-core`, `@simplysf/simply-apex-core`, `@simplysf/simply-document-core`,
`@simplysf/simply-report`) live in the sibling [`simply-node`](https://github.com/SimplySF/simply-node)
repo and are ordinary published npm dependencies here — there is no workspace-protocol link between
the two repos. Bumping one of them is like bumping any other dependency; see
[Adding a Dependency](#adding-a-dependency).

There's also a top-level [`site/`](site) directory — the [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation site, deployed to GitHub Pages. It's part of the pnpm workspace (so `pnpm install` at the root sets it up too), but it's not a `packages/*` entry, so Lerna never versions, publishes, or runs `build`/`test`/`lint` scripts against it. See [`site/README` conventions below](#documentation-site) for how to work on it.

Tooling:

- **Package manager:** pnpm workspaces
- **Task orchestration:** Lerna v10 (independent versioning) + Wireit (per-package build caching)
- **Language:** TypeScript (ESM)
- **Node:** ^22.13.0 || ^24.0.0 || ^26.0.0 (required by Lerna 10; the published CLI plugins themselves only require >=22.0.0)

## Setup

This repo pins its pnpm version via the `packageManager` field in `package.json`. Use [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) (bundled with Node.js) to install that exact version rather than installing pnpm globally:

```sh
corepack enable
git clone git@github.com:SimplySF/simply-plugins.git
cd simply-plugins
corepack install   # installs the pnpm version pinned in package.json
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm test
```

`corepack enable` only needs to be run once per machine. After that, Corepack transparently uses whatever version of pnpm is pinned in `package.json`, so every contributor and CI job runs the same version.

`pnpm install` at the root installs and links every workspace package and sets up git hooks automatically via husky.

To try your changes with the Salesforce CLI, run a plugin's local dev binary from inside its package directory:

```sh
cd packages/simply-data
./bin/dev.cmd simply data file upload --file-path fileToUpload.txt --target-org myTargetOrg
```

or link the package so you can run it from anywhere:

```sh
sf plugins link .
sf plugins
```

## Common Commands

Run from the repo root to target all packages:

```sh
pnpm run build       # lerna run build (compile + lint)
pnpm run compile     # lerna run compile
pnpm run lint        # lerna run lint
pnpm run test        # lerna run test
pnpm run test:only   # lerna run test:only
pnpm run format      # lerna run format
pnpm run reset       # clear node_modules, the lockfile, and all wireit/TS/ESLint caches
pnpm run reset:install  # same as reset, then reinstall dependencies
```

Run inside a single package directory to target just that package:

```sh
cd packages/simply-data
pnpm run build
pnpm test
```

## Adding a Dependency

To add a dependency to a specific package:

```sh
pnpm add <package> --filter @simplysf/simply-data
```

This applies the same way to the `simply-node` libraries (`@simplysf/simply-core`, etc.) — they
resolve from the npm registry like any other dependency, since there's no workspace link across the
two repos.

To add a root-level devDependency (e.g., a shared build tool):

```sh
pnpm add -w -D <package>
```

## Documentation Site

The [docs site](https://simplysf.github.io/simply-plugins/) lives in [`site/`](site) — an [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) site, deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on every push to `main` that touches `site/**` or any package's `README.md`/`package.json`.

```sh
pnpm --filter site run dev     # local preview at http://localhost:4321/simply/, auto-regenerates command reference pages
pnpm --filter site run build   # production build to site/dist, run before opening a PR that touches site/
```

Every page under `site/src/content/docs/cicd/reference/` and `site/src/content/docs/plugins/` is auto-generated by `site/scripts/sync-command-reference.mjs` from each package's oclif README — don't hand-edit those files, edit the source package's `messages/*.md` (then run that package's `pnpm run readme`) instead. Everything else under `site/src/content/docs/` (concepts, guides, the landing page) is hand-authored.

Internal links between docs pages should be root-relative (e.g. `/cicd/concepts/happy-soup-vs-project/`) — a remark plugin (`site/plugins/remark-base-links.mjs`) rewrites these to account for the site's `/simply` base path at build time. This does **not** apply to Starlight's `hero.actions` frontmatter on the landing page (`site/src/content/docs/index.mdx`), which needs the `/simply` prefix written out by hand — see the comment there if you're changing those links.

## Commit Messages

Commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (enforced by commitlint on commit). This matters beyond style: Lerna uses your commit types during release to decide which packages get versioned and how their `CHANGELOG.md` is generated.

```text
feat: add support for X
fix: correct handling of Y
docs: update README
chore: bump a dependency
```

If your change only affects one package, scope the commit to it, e.g. `feat(simply-data): add --max-parallel-jobs flag`.

## Pull Requests

- Keep pull requests focused on a single change where possible.
- If the change has a design document in [`docs/design/`](docs/design/README.md), update it to match what actually shipped, including its `Status` line and its row in the index. A design doc that quietly disagrees with the code is worse than none.
- Make sure `pnpm run build` and `pnpm test` pass before opening the PR. CI runs both across every package; the pre-push hook runs the same checks but scoped to packages changed since the last release tag (see [Git Hooks](#git-hooks)), so a passing push doesn't guarantee a passing PR if your branch touches a root-level config file (e.g. `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`) that no single package's directory reflects.
- Aim for high test coverage on new code.
- Update the relevant package's README/command docs if you changed a command's flags or behavior. `packages/simply-data` regenerates its README command docs automatically on version bump (`oclif readme` runs from its `version` script); every other plugin package requires running `pnpm run readme` manually in that package and committing the result.
- `command-snapshot.json` (used to flag accidental breaking changes to commands/flags) regenerates automatically as part of each package's `pnpm run build` — just commit whatever changes. CI re-verifies with `git diff --exit-code` after `pnpm run build`, so a stale, uncommitted snapshot fails the build. This includes `packages/simply`'s own `command-snapshot.json` when you change a plugin bundled into `@simplysf/simply` (see the orchestrator's `oclif.plugins` list): its wireit `command-snapshot` task cross-depends on every bundled plugin's `compile` task, so a root `pnpm run build` (or `pnpm run build` from within `packages/simply`) picks up dependency flag changes and regenerates it without any extra step.

## Versioning and Publishing

Versioning uses Lerna's independent mode — each package has its own version and can release separately.

The `release` workflow runs on pushes to `main` and, in a single step, bumps versions, updates each package's `CHANGELOG.md`, creates git tags in the format `@simplysf/simply@<version>`, pushes them, creates a GitHub release per changed package, and publishes each bumped package to npm:

```sh
lerna publish --conventional-commits --create-release github --yes
```

### Prerelease

Push to a `prerelease/**` branch (e.g., `prerelease/my-feature`) to trigger a prerelease, versioned and published the same way:

```sh
lerna publish --conventional-commits --conventional-prerelease --preid dev --create-release github --yes
```

### Recovering a Failed Publish

If a version was tagged and released but npm publish failed for one or more packages (e.g. a registry outage), trigger the `release` workflow manually (`workflow_dispatch`) with the `prerelease` input left blank. This runs `lerna publish from-package --yes`, which compares each package's committed version against what's actually on npm and publishes anything missing, without bumping versions again.

## CI

| Workflow      | Trigger                                               | What it does                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test.yml`    | Push to non-main branches                             | Runs `pnpm run build` + `pnpm test` on Linux (lts/_, lts/-1) and Windows (lts/_)                                                                                                        |
| `release.yml` | Push to `main` or `prerelease/**`, or manual dispatch | Runs `pnpm run build` + `pnpm test`, then bumps versions, tags, creates GitHub releases, and publishes to npm in one step (see [Versioning and Publishing](#versioning-and-publishing)) |

## Git Hooks

| Hook         | Command                                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | `lint-staged` — runs `prettier --write` on staged files                                       |
| `commit-msg` | `commitlint` — enforces conventional commit format                                            |
| `pre-push`   | `lerna run build --since --include-dependents && lerna run test --since --include-dependents` |

`pre-push` only builds/tests packages changed since the last release tag (plus their transitive
dependents) to keep the hook fast locally — CI (`test.yml`) always runs `pnpm run build` + `pnpm test`
across every package, so nothing changed here reduces what actually gates a merge.

Hooks are installed automatically on `pnpm install` via the `prepare: husky` script.
